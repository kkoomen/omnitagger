# The purpose of omnitagger
The purpose of omnitagger was a personal issue we all can relate to in the early days:
You download an album or song using a YouTube converter
(or oldschool Limewire/Frostwire back in those days) and the names do look
horrible. Names with numbers in front of it while it is already in the metatags,
underscores instead of spaces... you get it. This was an issue me and a friend
of mine always had and I suddenly had the idea to create a python script to make
from an ugly and horrible-looking filename a good-looking filename with metatags
set correctly automatically. Once I had the idea I kept building and building
and sometimes even rebuilding the whole script to make it better and more
efficient.
